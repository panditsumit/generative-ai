They take 2\\u20132 1/2 hours of gentle simmering. When the beans are soft, let the liquid reduce. It is usual to take out a ladle or two of the beans and to mash them with some of the cooking liquid, then stir this back into the beans. This is to thicken the sauce.\\r\\nServe the beans in soup bowls sprinkled with chopped parsley and accompanied by Arab bread.\\r\\nPass round the dressing ingredients for everyone to help themselves: a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil, the quartered lemons, salt and pepper, a little saucer with the crushed garlic, one with chili-pepper flakes, and one with ground cumin.\\r\\nThe beans are eaten gently crushed with the fork, so that they absorb the dressing.\\r\\nOptional Garnishes\\r\\nPeel hard-boiled eggs\\u20141 per person\\u2014to cut up in the bowl with the beans.\\r\\nTop the beans with a chopped cucumber-and-tomato salad and thinly sliced mild onions or scallions.
